qtim_Phantoms is a repository for downloading digital phantoms, or "digital reference objects" created by the Quantiative Tumor Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (<a href="https://qtim-lab.github.io/">QTIM</a>). Included in this repository will be:

- DCE-MRI phantom data derived from the publically-available RIDER datasets on TCIA. Utilities for adding artifical sources of motion and noise are available. This package is under active development, and will be released soon.
- Radiomics phantom data for commonly-derived shape and texture features. This package is under active development.
